### Test Compilation Issues with `tokio_test::block_on`

**Problem:**
- Tests were using `#[test]` with `tokio_test::block_on` pattern which failed to compile
- Error: `tokio_test` crate wasn't available as a dependency

**Solution:**
```rust
// Changed from:
#[test]
fn test_extract_credential_public_key_success() {
    tokio_test::block_on(async { ... });
}

// To:
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_extract_credential_public_key_success() {
    crate::test_utils::init_test_environment().await;
    // ... test body
}
```

**Key Insight:** For async tests in this codebase, use `#[tokio::test]` instead of blocking patterns. The `tokio` crate is already a dependency via `tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }`.

### WebAuthn RP ID Hash Validation Issues

**Problem:**
- Test was failing with "Invalid RP ID hash" error
- Root cause: Mismatch between test origins and expected RP ID hashes

**Analysis:**
- Test environment (`.env_test`) configured with `ORIGIN='https://example.com'`
- Test helper functions were using `"https://localhost:3000"` origin
- WebAuthn spec requires RP ID hash to match the origin's hostname

**Solution:**
1. **Origin Consistency:** Updated test helper to use `"https://example.com"` instead of `"https://localhost:3000"`
2. **RP ID Hash Fix:** Changed from SHA256("localhost") to SHA256("example.com"):
   ```rust
   // Old hash (SHA256("localhost")):
   auth_data.extend_from_slice(&[
       0x6d, 0xc4, 0xc2, 0x9d, 0x90, 0x1f, 0x36, 0xf4,
       // ... rest of localhost hash
   ]);

   // New hash (SHA256("example.com")):
   auth_data.extend_from_slice(&[
       0xa3, 0x79, 0xa6, 0xf6, 0xee, 0xaf, 0xb9, 0xa5,
       0x5e, 0x37, 0x8c, 0x11, 0x80, 0x34, 0xe2, 0x75,
       0x1e, 0x68, 0x2f, 0xab, 0x9f, 0x2d, 0x30, 0xab,
       0x13, 0xd2, 0x12, 0x55, 0x86, 0xce, 0x19, 0x47,
   ]);
   ```

**Testing Insight:** Always ensure test data consistency across:
- Environment configuration (`.env_test`)
- Test helper functions (origin URLs)
- Mock WebAuthn data (RP ID hashes, client data JSON)

### User Verification Flag Issues

**Additional Problem Found:**
- Another test was failing due to incorrect authenticator data flags
- WebAuthn requires User Verification flag when user verification is performed

**Solution:**
```rust
// Changed from:
auth_data.push(0x41); // user present + attested credential data

// To:
auth_data.push(0x45); // user present + user verified + attested credential data
```

**Key Learning:** WebAuthn authenticator data flags must accurately reflect the authentication ceremony:
- `0x01`: User Present (UP)
- `0x04`: User Verified (UV)
- `0x40`: Attested Credential Data Present (AT)
- Combined: `0x45` = UP + UV + AT

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Issues

When implementing unit tests for the coordination module, we encountered several critical failures:

1. **Database Initialization Race Conditions**: Tests were failing intermittently with "no such table" errors
2. **Inconsistent Test Behavior**: Some tests passed when run individually but failed when run as a group
3. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: Incomplete test setup patterns across different modules

### Root Cause Discovery

Through systematic investigation, we discovered the fundamental issue:

**In-memory SQLite databases with concurrent test execution create separate database instances per connection, making global initialization insufficient.**

Key findings:
- The `init_test_environment()` function from `test_utils` uses a global `OnceCell` to ensure database initialization happens only once
- However, with in-memory SQLite (`sqlite::memory:`), each test connection can get a fresh database instance
- This means that even though initialization ran once globally, individual test connections might not have the necessary tables

## Solution Strategy

### Pattern Analysis

We identified that OAuth2Store tests were consistently passing while UserStore tests were failing. Investigation revealed the key difference was in database initialization patterns.

### The Root Cause Revealed

The fundamental issue was not just missing initialization, but **database connection instance isolation** with in-memory SQLite:

1. **`init_test_environment()` uses `OnceCell`** to run initialization once globally
2. **However, with in-memory SQLite**, each new connection from the pool can get a fresh database instance
3. **Even with `cache=shared`**, connection timing and pooling can create separate database instances
4. **Result**: Tables created during global initialization exist only on that specific connection

### Improved Solution

Instead of repeating explicit store initialization in every test, we created a better approach:

**New Pattern (`init_test_environment_with_db()`):**
```rust
#[serial] // or #[tokio::test]
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_name() {
    use crate::test_utils::init_test_environment_with_db;
    init_test_environment_with_db().await;

    // Test logic...
}
```

This function:
1. Calls the original `init_test_environment()` for global setup
2. Then ensures tables exist on the current connection
3. Makes the intent clear and reduces code duplication

**Legacy Pattern (still works but verbose):**
```rust
#[serial]
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_name() {
    init_test_environment().await;

    // Explicit store initialization - necessary due to connection isolation
    UserStore::init().await.expect("Failed to initialize UserStore");
    OAuth2Store::init().await.expect("Failed to initialize OAuth2Store");
    PasskeyStore::init().await.expect("Failed to initialize PasskeyStore");

    // Test logic...
}
```

### Systematic Fix Implementation

We applied the working pattern to all failing tests:

1. **Identified all failing tests**: 8 out of 10 user tests were failing
2. **Applied consistent fix**: Added explicit store initialization to each failing test
3. **Added explanatory comments**: Documented why this pattern is necessary
4. **Verified fixes**: Confirmed each test passes individually and as a group

## Technical Implementation Details

### Store Initialization Pattern

```rust
// Explicitly ensure tables exist for this test's connection
// This is necessary for in-memory databases where each test may get a fresh instance
UserStore::init()
    .await
    .expect("Failed to initialize UserStore");
OAuth2Store::init()
    .await
    .expect("Failed to initialize OAuth2Store");
PasskeyStore::init()
    .await
    .expect("Failed to initialize PasskeyStore");
```

### Why This Works

1. **Per-Connection Initialization**: Each test explicitly ensures its database connection has the required tables
2. **Idempotent Operations**: Store `init()` methods are safe to call multiple times
3. **Explicit Dependencies**: Makes database requirements clear and testable
4. **Deterministic Behavior**: Eliminates race conditions and timing issues

### Database Configuration Context

From `.env_test`:
```env
DB_TABLE_PREFIX=test_o2p_
DATABASE_URL=sqlite::memory:
```

The in-memory SQLite configuration, while excellent for test isolation and speed, creates the connection-specific database instance behavior that necessitates explicit initialization.

## Best Practices Derived

### 1. Explicit Store Initialization in Tests

**Always include explicit store initialization** in tests that interact with the database:

```rust
#[serial]
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_function() {
    init_test_environment().await;

    // Required for database tests
    UserStore::init().await.expect("Failed to initialize UserStore");
    OAuth2Store::init().await.expect("Failed to initialize OAuth2Store");
    PasskeyStore::init().await.expect("Failed to initialize PasskeyStore");

    // Test implementation...
}
```

### 2. Test Isolation with Unique Identifiers

Use timestamp-based unique identifiers to prevent test interference:

```rust
let timestamp = chrono::Utc::now().timestamp_millis();
let user_id = format!("test-user-{}", timestamp);
```

### 3. Comprehensive Cleanup

Include cleanup logic where appropriate:

```rust
// Clean up - delete test data
UserStore::delete_user(&user_id).await.ok();
```

### 4. Serial Test Execution

Use `#[serial]` for tests that share database state:

```rust
#[serial]
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_function() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

## Testing Patterns by Module

### User Store Tests
- **Pattern**: Explicit initialization + unique identifiers + cleanup
- **Challenges**: Multiple store dependencies (User, OAuth2, Passkey)
- **Solution**: Initialize all required stores

### OAuth2 Store Tests
- **Pattern**: Already working with explicit initialization
- **Insight**: This module set the standard that others needed to follow

### Admin Tests
- **Pattern**: Proper use of `init_test_environment()` + `#[serial]`
- **Special Considerations**: Admin privilege testing, first user protection

## Performance and Reliability Metrics

### Before Fix
- **User Tests**: 2/10 passing (20% success rate)
- **Overall Coordination**: 26/34 passing (76% success rate)
- **Reliability**: Intermittent failures, timing-dependent

### After Fix
- **User Tests**: 10/10 passing (100% success rate)
- **Overall Coordination**: 34/34 passing (100% success rate)
- **Reliability**: Consistent, deterministic results

## Architecture Insights

### Database Connection Management

The testing revealed important characteristics of our database architecture:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Each test may get a different connection from the pool
2. **In-Memory Isolation**: In-memory databases are created per connection
3. **Initialization Scope**: Global initialization doesn't guarantee per-connection state

### Store Dependencies

Tests revealed the dependency graph:
- UserStore tests often need OAuth2Store and PasskeyStore
- Admin tests need UserStore
- OAuth2 and Passkey tests are more self-contained

## Debugging Methodology

### Investigation Process

1. **Identify Patterns**: Compare working vs failing tests
2. **Isolate Variables**: Run tests individually vs in groups
3. **Examine Differences**: Compare implementation patterns
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Apply working patterns to failing tests
5. **Verification**: Confirm fixes work consistently

### Debugging Tools Used

- `cargo test` with module filtering
- `#[serial]` for controlled execution
- Timestamp-based test isolation
- Explicit error handling with `.expect()`

## Future Recommendations

### Test Infrastructure

1. **Template Tests**: Create test templates that include the proper initialization pattern
2. **Test Utilities**: Consider helper functions that encapsulate the initialization pattern
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of testing patterns

### Database Testing Strategy

1. **Consider Test Fixtures**: For complex test data setup
2. **Transaction Rollback**: Explore using database transactions for test cleanup
3. **Test Database Seeding**: Consider pre-seeded test databases for integration tests

### Continuous Integration

1. **Test Matrix**: Run tests in different configurations (serial vs parallel)
2. **Flaky Test Detection**: Monitor for intermittent failures
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution times

## Conclusion

The coordination module testing experience provided valuable insights into:

- **Database testing patterns** with in-memory SQLite
- **Race condition identification** and resolution
- **Systematic debugging** approaches for complex systems
- **Best practices** for Rust async testing with databases

The resulting test suite is now robust, deterministic, and provides a solid foundation for future development. The patterns established here should be applied consistently across the codebase to maintain test reliability and developer productivity.

## Appendix: Command Reference

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all coordination tests
cargo test coordination::

# Run specific module tests
cargo test coordination::user::
cargo test coordination::admin::
cargo test coordination::oauth2::

# Run single test
cargo test coordination::user::tests::test_get_all_users
```

### Test Development Workflow

1. Write test with proper initialization pattern
2. Run test individually to verify functionality
3. Run test group to verify no interference
4. Run full coordination suite to verify integration
5. Commit with descriptive message

This systematic approach ensures test reliability and maintainability.

## Final Solution: Shared Cache Configuration

### The Complete Fix

After extensive investigation, we discovered the definitive solution was to use **SQLite shared cache mode** in the test environment. This was already configured in `.env_test` but needed proper environment setup.

**Key Configuration:**

```bash
export GENERIC_DATA_STORE_URL="sqlite:file:memdb1?mode=memory&cache=shared"
export GENERIC_CACHE_STORE_TYPE=memory
export GENERIC_CACHE_STORE_URL=memory://test
export GENERIC_DATA_STORE_TYPE=sqlite
```

**Why this works:**

- `cache=shared` ensures all SQLite connections share the same in-memory database instance
- Named memory database (`file:memdb1?mode=memory`) provides persistence across connections
- Connection pool isolation is eliminated - all tests see the same database state

### Test Execution

**Recommended command:**

```bash
# Use the provided script
./run_tests.sh

# Or set environment manually
export GENERIC_DATA_STORE_URL="sqlite:file:memdb1?mode=memory&cache=shared"
# ... other exports ...
cargo test --lib -p oauth2_passkey
```

**Results:**

- ✅ All 491 tests consistently pass
- ✅ No more "no such table" errors
- ✅ No more foreign key constraint failures
- ✅ Stable test execution across multiple runs

### Architecture Changes Made

1. **Removed problematic `OnceCell` pattern** in `test_utils.rs`:
   - Old: Global `OnceCell` that prevented re-initialization
   - New: Always run store initialization on current connection

2. **Added `#[serial]` attributes** to storage-level tests:
   - Prevents parallel execution conflicts
   - Ensures test isolation where needed

3. **Updated test initialization**:
   - Explicit `init_test_environment()` calls in integration tests
   - Proper database initialization on each connection

4. **Environment configuration**:
   - Created `run_tests.sh` script for easy test execution
   - Documented proper environment setup

### Lessons Learned

1. **In-memory SQLite behavior**: Each connection can get separate database instances without shared cache
2. **Connection pool isolation**: Even singletons can have per-connection state
3. **Test environment consistency**: Proper environment setup is critical for test stability
4. **Shared cache is essential**: `cache=shared` parameter is required for test reliability
