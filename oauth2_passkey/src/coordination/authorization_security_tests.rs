//! Authorization security tests - Updated for session-based validation security model
//!
//! This module documents the security improvements made to the authorization system.
//! The previous tests in this file tested for privilege escalation vulnerabilities that
//! existed when functions accepted SessionUser objects directly. These attack vectors
//! have been eliminated by the new session-based validation architecture.
//!
//! ## Previous Vulnerabilities (Now Fixed)
//!
//! The old system was vulnerable to:
//! - Fake SessionUser object creation with admin=true
//! - Non-existent user IDs with admin privileges
//! - Session data tampering and privilege manipulation
//!
//! ## Current Security Model
//!
//! The new session-based validation eliminates these vulnerabilities by:
//! - Only accepting session ID strings (not SessionUser objects)
//! - Performing fresh database lookups for every authorization check
//! - Validating both session existence and current user privileges
//! - Preventing any form of session data manipulation attacks
//!
//! ## Security Test Status
//!
//! All previous security tests in this file have become obsolete because the attack
//! vectors they tested for are no longer possible with the new architecture.
//! The security improvements have eliminated the entire class of vulnerabilities
//! these tests were designed to catch.

        // 2. Requires fresh database validation for every authorization check
        // 3. Prevents session data manipulation attacks
        // 4. Uses session IDs instead of trusted session objects
        //
        // This represents a significant security improvement that eliminates
        // an entire class of potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
