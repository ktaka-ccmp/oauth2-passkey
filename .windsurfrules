1. I want to publish this as a crate on crates.io
2. I want to make the code as simple as possible yet feasible
3. I want to make the code dependencies on other crates as little as possible 
4. I hear anyhow crate is not for library crates
5. I want to include nice tutorial and examples
6. I want to make the liboauth2 crate usable just by nesting as a route
7. I want the code modifications by cascade to be minimal, as simple as possible while fullfilling the needs of the prompt
8. I want to make the visibility of the library and modules as minimal as possible
9. When we need more visibility I want to re-export necessary items only
10. I want the commit messages reflecting the changes actually made
