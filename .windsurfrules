# Development Guidelines

**Primary Reference**: See `CLAUDE.md` for complete development guidelines.

All development guidelines have been consolidated into `CLAUDE.md` including:

## Library Design Principles
- Publication readiness for crates.io
- Simplicity and minimal dependencies  
- Error handling with thiserror (not anyhow)
- Minimal visibility and proper re-exports

## Development Workflow
- Minimal, targeted changes only
- Explicit approval required for scope changes
- Meaningful commit messages
- Error safety (avoid unwrap/expect)

## Testing Standards  
- Incremental testing (one test at a time)
- Approval required before proceeding to next file
- Non-invasive testing approach
- Test placement at bottom of files
- Use test_utils module for setup

## Code Quality
- Clippy enforcement (automated via pre-commit hook)
- Consistent formatting
- Fact-based documentation only

**Please review and follow ALL guidelines in CLAUDE.md when making code suggestions.**
