1. I want to publish this as a crate on crates.io
2. I want to make the code as simple as possible yet feasible
3. I want to make the code dependencies on other crates as little as possible 
4. I hear anyhow crate is not for library crates so I want to use thiserror crate instead
5. I want to include nice tutorial and examples
7. I want the code modifications by cascade to be minimal, as simple as possible while fullfilling the needs of the prompt
8. I want to make the visibility of the library and module internals as minimal as possible
9. When we need more visibility I want to re-export necessary items only
10. I want the commit messages reflecting the changes actually made, and with intentions
11. Avoid using unwrap() or expect() unless absolutely reasonable.
12. Even when you voluntarily notice some changes are feasible, never modify the code beyond my requests without first discussing the changes and explicit approval from me.
13. When I write unit tests for the library, I want to write them one by one, making sure each test passes before writing the next one.
14. When you want to proceed to the next file, ask for my approval first.
15. When you want to write multiple tests at once, ask for my approval first.
16. When writing tests, you should never modify the code that is not directly related to the test module.
17. The block of inline unit tests should be placed at the bottom of the file.
